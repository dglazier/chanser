* RGA Analysis Overview Notes
This doc will summerise the work needed to implement the analysis methods with
clas12root/chanser

** Trigger (mesonex)
 - Section: 2.4.2
 - Type: trigger
 - Description:
   An emulation of the trigger is needed to match the simulated data with
   experiment. This will need the same conditions on detectors that is
   implemnted for the actual hardware.
 - Notes:
   Some work on this is already complete (AT)

** Detector calibration fix
 - Section:3
 - Type: calibration
 - Description:
   A general task for any detector specific fixes that might be needed (similar
   to FT energy correction)
 - Notes:

** Run Selection (QC)
 - Section: 5.3
 - Type: cut
 - Description:
   Run that have been deemed to have any type of issue that might impact
   analysis has been labeled with a quality rating called 'defect'. The details
   on the values for this are given in the analysis note. 
 - Notes:
   Choose which level of defect is acceptable

** Note on 7.1.1
   If we don't use our own particle ID, then the following here will be useful
   in defining the selection criteria 

** Electron PCAL Min Energy Dep Cut
 - Section: 7.3.1.1
 - Type: cut
 - Description:
   Using an electron energy deposition cut on the ECAL to help with electron/pi-
   miss-ID
 - Notes:
   PCAL cut of 0.06

** Electron Sampling fraction
 - Section: 7.3.1.2
 - Type: cut 
 - Description:
   To further reduce the pi- contamination in the electrons, using the mean of
   the sampling fraction (the ratio of the sum of energy deposited in the
   calorimeter layers to reconstructed track momentum, vs deposited energy for
   each pre-shower calorimeter sector) and only accepting electrons within 3.5
   sigma. 
   Additionally a cut can also be placed on a function of sampling fraction of
   the inner calorimeter and the PCAL (linear slope, see secton for detail).
 - Notes:

** Electron z-vertex position
 - Section: 7.3.1.3
 - Type: cut
 - Description:
   Remove electrons scattered in the beamline or at the exit window of the
   target using the V_z value:
   -13cm < V_z < +12cm (in-bending)
   -18cm < V_z < +10cm (out-bending)
 - Notes:
   Torus field dependent!!
   
** Hadron ID: Electron vs. Hadron vertex diff
 - Section: 7.3.2.1
 - Type: cut
 - Description: 
   Rejecting hadrons outside of the target region, loose cut on vertex between
   hadron and electron of 20cm
   | Vz (ele) âˆ’ Vz (had) | < 20 cm
 - Notes:
   Can apply to both inbending outbending

** Hadron ID: chi2PID cuts
 - Section: 7.3.2.2
 - Type: cut
 - Description:
   Use the chi2PID value (distance in sigma from 0 of a delta time calculation)
   to restrict the hadrons. Details in section of the momentum dependent cuts
 - Notes:

** Photons: Max Beta at Calorimeter
 - Section: 7.3.3.1
 - Type: cut
 - Description:
   Set a maximum value for the photon beta at the calorimeter of 1.1 to remove
   uncorrelated photons from previous bunches
 - Notes:

** Fiducial: PCAL 
 - Section: 7.4.1
 - Type: fiducial cut
 - Description:
   Tracking efficiences near the edge of the PCAL reduces the electron and photo
   PID. The doc gives 3 different levels of cut to apply, corresponding to bar
   widths from the edge of the detector volume (v and w).
 - Notes:

** Fiducial: DC
 - Section: 7.4.2.1
 - Type: fiducial cut
 - Description:
   - Approach 1
     Fitting the events as a function of phi and theta, bounds on the angles
     have been calculated. Slightly different treatment given to electrons and
     other particles. The values for the cuts are not actually given in the doc!
   - Approach 2
     The same method but using x and y positions instead of angle. No values
     given for this either.
 - Notes:
   Approach 1 for hadrons, approach 2 for electrons. We need to values for the
   cuts however!

** Template task
